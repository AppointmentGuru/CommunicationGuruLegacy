A mock backend to be used in testing.

Typically, you'll want to decorate your TestCase or method with:

@override_settings(SMS_BACKEND='services.backends.mocksms.MockSMSBackend')

for mocking:

```
from services.backends.mocksms import MockSMSBackend
@mock.patch.object(MockSMSBackend, 'send')
def test_something(self, mock_sms)
    ...
```
